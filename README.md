This is a widget you can include in your site either in corner or whatever place you like it!!
to run this on your Chrome browser you need to follow the steps:
Step-1 Download the files and open in vscode.
Step-2 Run the npm i command (Ofc you need to have a idea of nodejs and nodepackage how to install it and how to use it :) )
Step-3 open terminal in bash and run command npm i in that folder where u have downloaded the files.
Step-4 now run nodemon index.js( if you hit tab it would automatically it would autofill index.js that just give a sense of surety that u r in right folder)
Step-5 go on the browser and type localhost:3000 and enter and whoohaaa bingo the widget is here.
